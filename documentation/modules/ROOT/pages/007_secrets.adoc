== *Passing Secure Information into Applications*

====
*What will you learn?*

This short Module will introduce the concepts known as 'Secrets' which allow for the injection of encrypted information into the Applications

This will demonstrate the insertion of information that is secure to the Application, such as connection strings and passwords

After completing this Module you will understand the difference between Config Maps and Secrets, the usecases for the latter and how to create and manipulate these secrets
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apps.ocp1.azure.dso.digital.mod.uk

[WARNING]
====
*Please Read* - if you are using a *shared* project you may encounter issues with naming; this is because Objects within a *Project* must be _uniquely_ named. If someone
else is doing this course in the same Project they may have created objects with the names stated. +

*If you get an error when trying to create _anything_ as part of this module, add "__(your initials)" to the end of the Name attribute for the object
you are creating*
====

=== *Setting up an example Application for the module*

First we will setup an example Application to show the use of Secrets. This Application is the Quarkus application we used for examining ConfigMap entries in Module 006.

Make sure your UI is set to the Developer Perspective and your are viewing the *Topology* page. Click on *+Add* then *Import from Git*. In the Git repo textbox copy the following from below:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/utherp0/envchecker
----

Set the *Application* (which is the cosmetic Application Grouping) to *secrets-app* by selecting *Create Application* from the pulldown and entering secrets-app into the textbox. 

Change the name to *secretchecker*. Set the *Resource* type to generate to *DeploymentConfig*. Hit *Create* to start the build going.

=== *Creating a Secret*

On the lefthand menu click on *Secrets*.

[NOTE]
====
You will immediately note that there are a lot of pre-existing secrets in the Project. +

OpenShift 'eats its own dogfood' when it comes to Secrets. All the actions executed within the Project which, even though you issue requests to the control plane to change
object states and create objects within the Project, are actually carried out by internal *'Robots'* known as *Service Accounts*. +

There are specific Service Accounts within the Project to interact with the creation of Images (builder), which requires extended rights within OpenShift in order to put a composite image together,
and to deploy Images to Containers, which requires the extended rights to talk to the internal Registry. +

The default 'robot' for the Project, named appropriately as *default* does not have direct rights for these actions as there situations where the Project should not have access to building images or interacting with the 
Registry. +

From a Secrets perspective all the Service Accounts need a valid *dockercfg* configuration and these are stored as Secrets in the Project (with the appropriate Service Account name and a randomised set of letters/numbers). You can see these in the list +

Also OpenShift uses tokens for authenticated access to the RESTful API and these are provisioned automatically as part of the Project process; you will see these as well, again
named with the Service Account. +

You'll also notice distinct *Types* of Secret. These include *dockercfg* (for Docker Configuration), *service-account-token* (for authenticated access to the RESTful API) and *Opaque*.
====

On the *Secrets* panel click on *Create*. In the pulldown click on *From YAML*. Replace the text in the editor with the text shown below:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: admin
  password: opensesame
----

Then click on *Create* to add the Secret object to the Project. The UI will shift to show you the created Secret similar to below:

image::007-image004.png[Added Secret,width=550px]

Note that the contents of the Secret are encrypted at this point. This is the key difference between using *Secrets* and *ConfigMaps*.

=== *Adding a Secret to a Workload as Environment Variables*

Now click on the *Add Secret to workload* button on the Secret panel.

image::007-image005.png[Add Secret to Workload dialog,width=500px]

[TIP]
====
If you have more than one Application in your Project select *secretchecker* from the *DC* pulldown.
====

Make sure *Environment variables* is selected in *Add secret as*.

[TIP]
====
This mechanism takes the Secret information and injects it as environment variables.
====

Set the *Prefix* to *SECRET_* - copy and paste from below if necessary:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
SECRET_
----

Now click *Save*. Note how the system takes you back to DeploymentConfig panel and also watch the deployment redeploy; this is because the definition of the *DC* has changed (to include the environment variables from the Secret).

Go back to the Topology page and click on the route for the Application (the topright icon on the Roundel). When the Quarkus homepage appears add the following to the end of the url:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
/envs/search?terms=secret_
----

[TIP]
====
We are asking the Application to search all the environment variables it has access to for instances that contain (case insensitive) *secret_*.
====

The webpage rendered should display two environment variables as shown below:

image::007-image006.png[Search result, width=500px]

Notice that the contents of the secret have been exposed as environment variables and decrypted.

=== *Adding a Secret to a Workload as Files*

[TIP]
====
We are going to take advantage of the concept of mount points within a Container and use the OpenShift functionality to express the contents of the secret as files rather than environment variables.
====

Click on the *Secrets* link on the lefthand panel. Scroll down and find the *mysecret* secret. Click on the secret to open the *Secret details*.

Click on *Add Secret to workload*. Select the workload *DC secretchecker*. Set the *Add secret as* selector to *Volume*.

In the *Mount path* add the following text:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
/test
----

image::007-image007.png[Dialog for volume,width=500px]

[TIP]
====
What actually happens here is interesting. The system scans the secret for all name/value pairs, and then creates files in the Volume chosen, in this case */test*, named by the name and containing
the value.
====

Click *Save*. The UI will switch back to the Topology including the DC panel and you will see the Application being redeployed. In the righthand panel containing the overview
of the *DC* go to the *Pods* section and click on the running Pod. In the *Pod details* page click on *Terminal*.

[WARNING]
====
The security settings on the D2S cluster mean that it has a very short inactivity period for disconnecting the Terminal. If you get disconnected during this part of the Module simply click on *Terminal* again.
====

In the terminal type (or copy) the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
df -h
ls -al /test
cat /test/username
----

[TIP]
====
Note that the file system for /test is attached (using "df -h") +

Note that the files are links to other mounts +

Note that the file contains the decrypted contents of the *username* secret name/value pair
====

=== Cleaning up

[TIP]
====
When you create Applications in OpenShift they will remain resident until you remove them
====

To finish the Module head to the *Topology page*, click on each of the *Application Groups* (i.e. (A) config-app) and in the *Actions* menu on the righthand panel for the Application choose *Delete Application*.
The system will prompt you to enter the name of the Application Group; enter this name and press return/hit *Delete*.

[TIP]
====
Deleting the Application Group removes all of the Objects relating to the application
