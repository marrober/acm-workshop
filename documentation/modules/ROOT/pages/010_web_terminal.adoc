# The Web Terminal

Many users have locked down laptops and are unable to use install additional command line utilities for the hosted control plane section. To overcome this you can install the web terminal on OpenShift and then add the hosted control plane command line to that shell.

## Install the Web Terminal

To install the web terminal use the administrator perspective in the OpenShift web user interface by toggling the drop down option under the Red Hat OpenShift logo in the top left corner. 

From the menus on the left hand side select Operators and then select OperatorHub. 

In the filter box type 'web terminal' and select the icon with the title "Web Terminal, provided by Red Hat". 

Press the install button on the pop-up window on the right and the select the install button on the details page for the operator.

Wait for the operator to install for about a minute and then refresh the browser. You should see the additional icon for the web terminal which is the '>_' sign as shown below.
