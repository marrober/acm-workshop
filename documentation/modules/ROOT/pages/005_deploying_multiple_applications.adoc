== *Deploying Multiple Applications*

====
*What will you learn?*

This short module will introduce you to the concepts around deploying multiple Applications in the same Project

This will highlight the capabilities in terms of grouping and also the nature of implicit Service Discovery provided by OpenShift between Applications running in the same Project

After completing the Module you will understand the concepts of multiple Application hosting and the advantages provided working within a single Project
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.

[WARNING]
====
*Please Read* - if you are using a *shared* project you may encounter issues with naming; this is because Objects within a *Project* must be _uniquely_ named. If someone
else is doing this course in the same Project they may have created objects with the names stated. +

*If you get an error when trying to create _anything_ as part of this module, add "__(your initials)" to the end of the Name attribute for the object
you are creating*
====

=== *Installing the multiple Applications*

First we will install three Applications, two of which will be in the same Application Group.

Ensure you have followed the pre-requisites above. Switch to the *Topology* viewpoint if you are not already on it.

Select *+Add*. Choose *Import from Git*.

[TIP]
====
The *Import from Git* option is a nice fast-track way of setting up an Application; OpenShift will verify the Git repository, examinine it, and auto-deduce which
of the S2I (Source-2-Image) frameworks to use to build the Application. If there are multiple base framework images, i.e. if you choose Node.js there are a number of supported versions, the Wizard will
prompt you to choose which one to use.
====

Copy the following location into the *Git Repo URL*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/utherp0/bootcampapp
----

When you add the text the Wizard will validate the URL and provide you with the 'Red Hat OpenJDK17 (UBI 8)' framework.

[NOTE]
====
We are going to create a JAVA Application using the OpenJDK framework; this executes a Maven build but interestingly the source code is
actually *Quarkus*, a superb new spin of JAVA compilation that makes JAVA very fast to deploy with a smaller footprint.
====

Scroll down to *Application* and select *Create Application*. In the *Application Name* enter:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
group1-app
----

Set the *Name* to:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
application1
----

Leave all other options as they are and hit *Create*. When the topology page appears click on the Roundel for *Application1*.

[NOTE]
====
Under the *Pods* part of the tab you will see a message saying *'Waiting for the build'*. OpenShift/Kubernetes works by reconciling the actual physical components created against the desired state and when OpenShift
creates an application it creates *both* the BuildConfig, which builds the Application, and the Deployment/DeploymentConfig which deploys it. +

The Deployment will instantly try to create the Application, because that is the desired state it wants, but at this point the Build hasn't completed so the composite Image, made
up of the compiled source and the framework image, doesn't exist, so you can get warning messages.
====

Select *+Add* again. This time we will add a sample application just to show the functionality you can use for quickstarting an Application development.

Click on *Samples*.

Click on *Basic .NET*. Leave all the options as default and simply click on *Create*.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this option has far fewer parameters to choose from than a normal Application. That is because OpenShift sets up all the options you need specific to the Sample. +

Also note that the Application appears in an Application Grouping called *sample-app*.
====

Select *+Add* again. This time we will add an Application from a pre-built image. 

Click on *Container Images*. 

Copy the text below into the *Image name from external registry* field:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
quay.io/ilawson/functest
----

In the *General* tab pulldown the *Application* selection box and select *group1-app*. The *Name* should be autofilled with *functest*. Click on *Create*.

Your topology should now look something similar to this:

[TIP]
====
Note that you have two application groupings. These are effectively cosmetic but very useful for keeping track of your applications in a combined component way.
====

=== *Interacting with Application Groupings*

Now we are going to add the *dotnet-basic* sample into our group1-app application grouping. Hold down the *Shift* button, click and hold on the Roundel for the dotnet-basic application, and drag it into the *group1-app* area (within the boundary). Release the mouse button.

You will be prompted as to whether you want to move it - click *Move*.

image::005-image004.png[Confirmation,width=450px]

The topology page will now display a single Application Grouping with all three applications in it as shown below:

image::005-image005.png[Single Application grouping,with=500px]

Now hold the *Shift* key and select and hold on the Roundel for *application1*. Move it out of the group, release the button and hit *Remove*.

[NOTE]
====
In actuality this shows a powerful part of the OpenShift object model controls, the *Label*. +

Click on the Roundel for the *dotnet-basic* Application. In the right hand panel select *Details*. Scroll down to *Labels* and hit *Edit*. +

If you look at the Labels you will see one for "app.kubernetes.io/part-of" with the value *group1-app*. This indicates to OpenShift to group this _deployment_ in that Application Group.
====

What we are going to do now, to show the Labels in action, is manually edit the *Deployment* for application1 to add it back into the Application Grouping.

Click on the Roundel for *application1*. Select *Details*. Scroll down to *Labels* and click on *Edit*.

With the cursor in the textarea for the labels (it should be in there by default, if not simply click on the textarea), add:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
app.kubernetes.io/part-of=group1-app
----

Hit save and the topology will shift to include the Application in the group1-app Application Grouping.

Now click on actual Application Grouping label (where it says (A) group1-app) and the Application group will highlight in the topology, and the Application Grouping information will be displayed in the righthand panel as shown below:

image::005-image006.png[Highlighted Application Grouping,width=550px]

Use of the topology allows for high level operations to be applied to all components of an Application Grouping - to finish we will now remove all the Application components for all the Applications in the grouping.

Select the *Actions* pulldown in the group1-app details panel on the righthand side. Note that you can add directly to the Application Grouping here as well. Select *Delete Application*.

image::005-image007.png[Confirmation of removal,width=450px]

Note that it forces you to confirm by entering the Application Grouping name. Once you have entered the name in the textbox correctly the *Delete* button will become active. Click *Delete*.

[TIP]
====
Note that the confirmation panel details *all* the application components that will be deleted. This approach is a clean delete that removes all the object components.
