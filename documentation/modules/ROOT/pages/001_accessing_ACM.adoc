Now, navigate to the Clusters screen, you will notice that the Hub cluster is already in 
the list as a managed cluster (local-cluster), and other clusters may also be listed depending on the starting point for the workshop.

== View clusters

Select one of the clusters and click on the name link. 

=== Traditional control plane

If this is a 'traditional' cluster with physical or virtual nodes for the control plane then you will see a details section first, in the overview section. This contains information on the cluster loction and version together with links for the cluster API and console. it also contains the admin username and password for any clusters created by ACM.

=== Hosted control plane

If the cluster has a control plane which is hosted on the main cluster then the first section will be the control plane status showing information on the readiness of each element.
