= Cluster lifecycle

At a high level Cluster Lifecycle management is about creating, upgrading, and destroying 
and importing clusters in a multi cloud environment.

[NOTE]
====
Since you are sharing the ACM cluster with other users there are several areas where you
will see <initials>. Please replace this with your initials, or something appropriate 
and consistent to identify your content / clusters.
====

The facilitators will also provide to you :

* AWS credentials, 
* Access Key ID, 
* Secret Access Key,
* Base DNS Domain.  

== Create Credentials for AWS cloud environment

In order to create a new OpenShift cluster in the AWS cloud we will need these keys to 
create a Provider Connection. On the left bar, select Credentials and then select Add Credential.
