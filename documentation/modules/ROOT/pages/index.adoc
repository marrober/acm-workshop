== *An introduction to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management*

This workshop will guide you through the use of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)
for specific operations covering cluster management and cluster governance. Multiple people will 
use the workshop today and you will operate with a shared ACM management hub and managed 
clusters that are specific to you personally. 

== Workshop infrastructure

The workshop facilitators will give you URL's and credentials for the clusters that you will 
use throughout the workshop. 

Credentials will be provided for :

* The ACM Hub
* The AWS environment to which you need to connect the Hub cluster
* A single node OpenShift instance

The cluster configuration is shown below, with the shared ACM Hub cluster and 
individual managed clusters for each user.
